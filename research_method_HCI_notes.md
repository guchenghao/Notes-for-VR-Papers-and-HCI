# Notes for Research Method in Human Computer Interaction



## 1. Experimental Research

----

### 1.1 Relationships between three types of research

---

> Typical research projects include a combination of two or even three kinds of investigation.

>
* __Descriptive__: Descriptive investigations are often the first step of a research program, enabling researchers to identify interesting phenomena or events that establish the cornerstone of the research and identify future research directions.
  
* __Relational__: Relational investigations enable researchers or practitioners to discover connections between multiple events or variables.
  
* __Experimental__: Experimental research provides the opportunity to explore the fundamental causal relations

### 1.2 TYPICAL DEPENDENT VARIABLES IN HCI RESEARCH

---

> Dependent variables frequently measured can be categorized into five groups: __*efficiency, accuracy, subjective satisfaction, ease of learning and retention rate, and physical or cognitive demand*__.


>
* __Efficiency__: Efficiency describes how fast a task can be completed.
  
* __Accuracy__: Accuracy describes the states in which the system or the user makes errors.
  
* __Subjective satisfaction__: Subjective satisfaction describes the user's perceived satisfaction with the interaction experience. The data is normally collected using __*Likert scale ratings*__ (e.g., numeric scales from 1 to 5) through questionnaires.
  
* __Ease of Learning__: Ease of learning and retention rate describe how quickly and how easily an individual can learn to use a new application or complete a new task and how long they retain the learned skills

* __Physical or cognitive demand__: an application or a task exerts on an individual or how long an individual can interact with an application without significant fatigue.
