# Notes for Research Method in Human Computer Interaction



## 1. Experimental Research

----

### 1.1 Relationships between three types of research

---

> Typical research projects include a combination of two or even three kinds of investigation.

>
* __Descriptive__: Descriptive investigations are often the first step of a research program, enabling researchers to identify interesting phenomena or events that establish the cornerstone of the research and identify future research directions.
  
* __Relational__: Relational investigations enable researchers or practitioners to discover connections between multiple events or variables.
  
* __Experimental__: Experimental research provides the opportunity to explore the fundamental causal relations

### 1.2 TYPICAL DEPENDENT VARIABLES IN HCI RESEARCH

---

> Dependent variables frequently measured can be categorized into five groups: __*efficiency, accuracy, subjective satisfaction, ease of learning and retention rate, and physical or cognitive demand*__.


>
* __Efficiency__: Efficiency describes how fast a task can be completed.
  
* __Accuracy__: Accuracy describes the states in which the system or the user makes errors.
  
* __Subjective satisfaction__: Subjective satisfaction describes the user's perceived satisfaction with the interaction experience. The data is normally collected using __*Likert scale ratings*__ (e.g., numeric scales from 1 to 5) through questionnaires.
  
* __Ease of Learning__: Ease of learning and retention rate describe how quickly and how easily an individual can learn to use a new application or complete a new task and how long they retain the learned skills

* __Physical or cognitive demand__: an application or a task exerts on an individual or how long an individual can interact with an application without significant fatigue.

## 2. Experiment Design

----
### 2.1 Wizard-of-Oz approach

---

> The Wizard-of-Oz approach allows us to test *ideal applications* that do not exist in the real world. This approach is not without its limitations. Humans also make errors. It is very likely that the human “wizard” would make errors when listening to the dictation or when typing the words.


### 2.2 Between-group design and within-group design

---

> 
__Between-group design__ is also called “between-subject design.” between-group design has __notable disadvantages__. In a between-group experiment, we are comparing the performance of one group of participants against the performance of another group of participants. The results are subject to substantial impacts from __individual differences__. Recruiting __the number of participants__ needed for a between-group experiment can be a very challenging task.

A __within-group design__ (also called “within-subject design”) requires each participant to be exposed to multiple experimental conditions. The biggest problem with a within-group design is __*the possible impact of learning effects*__. For instance, suppose we are conducting a within-group experiment that evaluates two types of ATM: one with a button interface and one with a touch-screen interface. The task is to withdraw money from an existing account. If the participant first completes the task using the ATM with the button interface, the participant gains some experience with the ATM interface and its functions. Therefore, the participant may perform better when subsequently completing the same tasks using the ATM with the touch-screen interface. Another potential problem with within-group designs is __*fatigue*__
