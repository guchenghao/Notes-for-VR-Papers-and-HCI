[Predicting Opportune Moments to Deliver Notifications in Virtual Reality](https://doi.org/10.1145/3491102.3517529)


## Interruption and Notifcation Management

* Interruptions during tasks have many negative efects,such as decreasing task performance and impacting an individual’s emotional state.
  
* **The type of primary task**, **the level of task engagement**, and **the timing of an interruption**, could affect the disruptiveness of interruptions.
* 

## Attention and Interruptibility Prediction

* Earlier works have focused on interruptibility and breakpoint prediction in desktop or work place contexts.

* In recent years, increasing attention has been given to leveraging wearable sensors and mobile devices.

* Using **contextual information** provided by ***sensors, software events or self-reports*** has allowed researchers to build models for predicting interruptible and opportune moments for sending notifcations

* A recent study shows that even human beings may **falsely recognize** interruptible moments for a person wearing an HMD simply by observing their movement and gestures. (体现了VR这种特定场景下prediction任务还是比较有挑战性的)
