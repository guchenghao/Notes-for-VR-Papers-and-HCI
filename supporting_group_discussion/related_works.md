## Facilitating Group Chat Discussion by Improving Efficiency and Participation with a Chatbot


* we aimed to explore the feasibility of a **facilitator chatbot agent** to improve group chat discussions. We conducted a need-finding survey to identify key features of a facilitator chatbot. We then implemented GroupfeedBot, a chatbot agent that could facilitate group discussions by managing the discussion time, encouraging members to participate evenly, and organizing members' opinions

## Supporting controversial CSCL discussions with augmented group awareness tools

* The **basic idea** here is to require learners to rate the written contributions in an online discussion on one or more dimensions. The tool itself performs the functions of a): taking the learner ratings as input; b): aggregating and/or transforming these inputs; and c): visualizing and feeding back transformed contextual variables as graphical output to the group.

## Computer-supported collaborative learning: An analysis of the relationship between interaction, emotional support and online collaborative tools


* On the other hand, **online collaborative tools have proved to contribute to interaction between group members and to sustain emotional support**. Consequently, in order to model cognitive presence, social presence and teaching presence during CSCL it is necessary to promote a fluent and satisfactory interaction, rooted on the learning process and on emotional support as well as on effective management of the online tools facilitating collaboration.

## Audio based group conversation support system


* Although the various visual based group conversation support system have been proposed to increase the passive participant's utterance, these visually presentation of support information is disturbing the group communication by attracting participants' gaze attention. In this research, we proposed an audio based support system which focuses on an attentional behavior. **Our system gives a passive participant a chance to take next speaking turn by leading a mutual gaze with a current speaker with providing audio stimuli to them**.

## Supporting Collaborative Sequencing of Small Groups through Visual Awareness


* findings in CSCW, HCI, and Information Visualization (InfoVis) communities show that visually externalizing group members’ preferences and actions in group work, such as collaborative data analysis and collaborative information-seeking, could lead to better outcomes.
  
* Goyal and Fussell provided **visual awareness**, in the form of sensemaking translucence, to allow group members track their whole group’s activities during collaborative analysis.
  
* This **visual awareness** approach has also been adopted to support consensus building by visualizing opinions in groups.

## Group awareness tools: It’s what you do with it that matters

* **Another example of how group awareness tools** can be embedded in CSCL environments to give feedback to group members comes from the work of Zumbach and colleagues (Zumbach et al., 2004, Zumbach and Reimann, 2003). The environment tracks group members’ activity and feeds this back to the users in a pie chart. In sum, these group awareness tools provide group members with feedback on **how well they are collaborating** (i.e., are group members participating equally in the collaborative process?). In their studies Zumbach et al. showed that their group awareness tool positively affected students’ learning process, group performance, and motivation.（利用group awareness tools给予小组成员反馈可以增进他们的团队合作表现）

## Investigation of Small Group Social Interactions Using Deep Visual Activity-Based Nonverbal Features

* It is well known that, visual activity (VisualAct) is an important cue to identify social interactions in small groups [13, 47, 62]. The most prominent way to represent VisualAct were in terms of head activity (**head motion**) e.g. in [2, 5, 6, 39, 45, 54], body activity (**body motion**).

## Unobtrusive Analysis of Group Interactions without Cameras

* Factors including “group-think”, **fear of speaking**, unfocused discussion, and bias can affect the performance of a group meeting
  
* In order to actively or passively facilitate group meetings, automatically analyzing group interaction patterns is critical.

* manually coding such nonverbal behavior like location, gaze, gestures, head and body movements, posture, speaker segmentation, interruptions and so on, is **cumbersome, time-consuming and subjective**

* While the system provides valuable information, the array of cords, memory cards, and external PCs is not really compact and the position of the sensors in the lines of sights of participants may **appear obtrusive to the participants**.

## Using the Influence Model to Recognize Functional Roles in Meetings


* In order to improve performance of meetings, external interventions by experts such as facilitators and trainers are commonly employed. Facilitators participate in the meetings as external elements of the group and their role is to help participants maintaining a fair and focused behavior as well as directing and setting the pace of the discussion.

* by abstracting over low level (visual, acoustic, etc.) information to produce medium-/coarse-grained one about the social/relational roles members play in the group. The latter is the kind of information that most coaches and group facilitators (implicitly or explicitly) use while doing their job.

* The ***Task Area functional roles*** consist or: the **Orienteer** (o)—she orients the group by introducing the agenda, defining goals and procedures, keeping the group focused and on track and summarizing the most important arguments and the group decisions. The **Giver** (g): she provides factual information and answers to questions, states her beliefs and attitudes about an idea, expresses personal values and factual information. The **Seeker** (s), who requests information, as well as clarifications, to promote effective group decisions. The **Procedural Technician** (pt); she uses the resources available to the group, managing them for the sake of the group. The **follower** (f), who just listens, without actively participating in the interaction.

* The ***Socio-Emotional functional roles***: the **Attacker** (a); she deflates the status of others, expresses disapproval, and attacks the group or the problem. The **Gate-keeper** (gk), who is the group moderator, mediates the communicative relations, encourages and facilitates the participation and regulates the flow of communication. The **Protagonist** (p); she takes the floor, driving the conversation, assuming a personal perspective and asserting her authority. The **Supporter** (su), who shows a cooperative attitude demonstrating understanding, attention and acceptance as well as providing technical and relational support. The **Neutral Role** (n), played by those who passively accept the ideas of the others, serving as an audience in group discussion

## Forms of talk

* When a word is spoken, all those who happen to be in perceptual range of the event will have some sort of participation status relative to it.

* We can as handily quote another (directly or indirectly) as we can say something in our own name. (This embedding capacity is part of something more general: our linguistic ability to speak of events at any remove in time and space from the situated present.)

* Whenever persons talk there are very likely to be questions and answers. These utterances are realized at different points in "sequence time." Notwithstanding the content of their questions, questioners are .oriented to what lies just ahead, and depend on what is to come; answerers are oriented to what has just been said, and look backward, not forward. Observe that although a question anticipates an answer, is designed to receive it, seems dependent on doing so, an answer seems even more dependent, making less sense alone than does the utterance that called it forth. Whatever answers do, they must do this with something already begun.

* In questions and answers we have one example, perhaps the canonical one, of what Harvey Sacks has called a "first pair part" and a "second pair part," that is, a couplet, a minimal dialogic unit, a round two utterances long, each utterance of the same "type," each spoken by a different person, one utterance temporally following directly on the other; in sum, an example of an "adjacency pair." The first pair part establishes a "conditional relevance" upon anything that occurs in the slot that follows; whatever comes to be said there will be inspected to see how it might serve as an answer, and if nothing is said, then the resulting silence will be taken as notable-a rejoinder in its own right, a silence to be heard (Sacks 1973).

* On the face of it, these little pairings, these dialogic units, these two-part exchanges, recommend a linguistic mode of analysis of a formalistic sort. Admittedly, the meaning of an utterance, whether question or answer, can ultimately depend in part on the specific semantic value of the words it contains and thus (in the opinion of some linguists) escape complete formalization. Nonetheless, a formalism is involved. The constraining influence of the question-answer format is somewhat independent of what is being talked about, and whether, for example, the matter is of great moment to those involved in the exchange or of no moment at all. Moreover, each participating utterance is constrained by the rules of sentence grammar, even though, as will be shown, inferences regarding underlying forms may be required to appreciate this.
