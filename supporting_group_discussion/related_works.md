* The basic idea here is to require learners to rate the written contributions in an online discussion on one or more dimensions. The tool itself performs the functions of a): taking the learner ratings as input; b): aggregating and/or transforming these inputs; and c): visualizing and feeding back transformed contextual variables as graphical output to the group.
