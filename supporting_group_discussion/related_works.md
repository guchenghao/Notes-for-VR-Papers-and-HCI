* we aimed to explore the feasibility of a **facilitator chatbot agent** to improve group chat discussions. We conducted a need-finding survey to identify key features of a facilitator chatbot. We then implemented GroupfeedBot, a chatbot agent that could facilitate group discussions by managing the discussion time, encouraging members to participate evenly, and organizing members' opinions

* The basic idea here is to require learners to rate the written contributions in an online discussion on one or more dimensions. The tool itself performs the functions of a): taking the learner ratings as input; b): aggregating and/or transforming these inputs; and c): visualizing and feeding back transformed contextual variables as graphical output to the group.

* On the other hand, **online collaborative tools have proved to contribute to interaction between group members and to sustain emotional support**. Consequently, in order to model cognitive presence, social presence and teaching presence during CSCL it is necessary to promote a fluent and satisfactory interaction, rooted on the learning process and on emotional support as well as on effective management of the online tools facilitating collaboration.

* Although the various visual based group conversation support system have been proposed to increase the passive participant's utterance, these visually presentation of support information is disturbing the group communication by attracting participants' gaze attention. In this research, we proposed an audio based support system which focuses on an attentional behavior. **Our system gives a passive participant a chance to take next speaking turn by leading a mutual gaze with a current speaker with providing audio stimuli to them**.

* findings in CSCW, HCI, and Information Visualization (InfoVis) communities show that visually externalizing group members’ preferences and actions in group work, such as collaborative data analysis and collaborative information-seeking, could lead to better outcomes.
* Goyal and Fussell provided **visual awareness**, in the form of sensemaking translucence, to allow group members track their whole group’s activities during collaborative analysis.
* This **visual awareness** approach has also been adopted to support consensus building by visualizing opinions in groups.

* **Another example of how group awareness tools** can be embedded in CSCL environments to give feedback to group members comes from the work of Zumbach and colleagues (Zumbach et al., 2004, Zumbach and Reimann, 2003). The environment tracks group members’ activity and feeds this back to the users in a pie chart. In sum, these group awareness tools provide group members with feedback on **how well they are collaborating** (i.e., are group members participating equally in the collaborative process?). In their studies Zumbach et al. showed that their group awareness tool positively affected students’ learning process, group performance, and motivation.（利用group awareness tools给予小组成员反馈可以增进他们的团队合作表现）
