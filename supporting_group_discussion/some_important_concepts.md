# Important concepts


## 1. Big Five personality traits

The **Big Five personality traits**, also known as the **Five-Factor Model (FFM)**, is a widely recognized and empirically supported model of **personality**. Here is a brief explanation of each trait:

***Openness***: <u>**This trait reflects an individual's level of imagination, creativity, and appreciation for new experiences**</u>. People who score high on openness tend to be curious, open-minded, and willing to explore new ideas and perspectives. They may also be more likely to engage in artistic and intellectual pursuits.

***Conscientiousness***: <u>**This trait is characterized by a person's level of organization, responsibility, and self-discipline**</u>. Individuals who score high on conscientiousness tend to be reliable, diligent, and goal-oriented. They may also be more likely to plan ahead and stick to schedules.

***Extraversion***: This trait reflects an individual's level of sociability, assertiveness, and outgoingness. People who score high on extraversion tend to be talkative, energetic, and enjoy being around others. They may also be more likely to take risks and seek out stimulation.

***Agreeableness***: This trait is characterized by a person's level of compassion, cooperativeness, and concern for others. Individuals who score high on agreeableness tend to be empathetic, friendly, and willing to help others. They may also be more likely to avoid conflict and prioritize harmony in relationships.

***Neuroticism***: This trait reflects an individual's level of emotional instability and tendency towards negative emotions such as anxiety, depression, and stress. People who score high on neuroticism tend to be more sensitive, reactive, and prone to experiencing negative moods. They may also be more likely to worry and ruminate about past or future events.



## 2. PBL&TBL

### 2.1 TBL

***Team-Based Learning***: a form of collaborative learning that consists of (A) **Strategically-formed, permanent teams**, (B) **Readiness assurance**, (C) **Application activities**, and (D) **Peer evaluations**.



* **(B) Readiness assurance: The Readiness assurance process is followed by a clarifying lecture**
    1. Pre-reading by students outside of class;
    2. **Individual readiness assessment test** (iRAT) $\rightarrow$ **short, basic, multiple-choice test** over the preparation materials;
    3. **Team readiness assessment test** (tRAT) $\rightarrow$ once they turn in their individual tests, students then take the exact same test again, and must come to consensus on their team answers;
    4. **Appeals** - When teams feel they can still make a case for their answers which were marked as incorrect, they can pull out their course materials and generate written appeals.


* **(C) Application activities: carefully-designed activities**
    1. address a **significant problem** that demonstrates a concepts usefulness
    2. make a **Specific choice** among clear alternatives
    3. work on the Same problem as other teams
    4. report their decisions Simultaneously, so differences among teams can be explored for the most instructional effect

**Main features of TBL:**

* Emphasizes **APPLICATION of teacher- specified knowledge** to address real world problems In autonomous teams;
* Students benefit from immediate feedback about their teams` solutions




### 2.2 PBL

**Instructional Method**
* Tutors progressively disclose Information in cases. Learners analyze material, address knowledge deficiencies, study between sessions and come prepared to apply new knowledge to tutor led discussions




**Main features of PBL:**
* Student directed learning stimulated by challenge of solving real world problems in tutor led groups
* Learners benefit from opportunity to solve these problems



### 2.3 Comparison advs. vs disadvs of PBL Methods


Compared with **traditional cramming education**, the advantages of
PBL teaching method are as follows:


1. **Students' learning is more exploratory and initiative**.

The PBL teaching method is based on students and questions. Students can obtain solutions and answers to problems through discussion and data review. It makes student’s learning change from passive to active, from blind to purposeful to active
exploration and searches for the answer.

2. **Students are learning how to ask questions and more participatory**.

Through the exploration and solution of individual problems, students not only gain knowledge but also learn to understand the ideas. At the same time, the exploration of solving problems became the model of discovering problems, asking questions and
solving problems.

3. **Stimulate students’ interest in learning thinking skill and problem-solving ability**.

Morales-Mann (2001) proposes that problem-based, groupbased learning and discussion can significantly improve students’ability to analyze and solve problems in the learning process of basic and clinical knowledge.



Most students like this learning model of mutual cooperation, but **there are also some problems**. These problems are organized as follows:
1. **Insufficient of teacher supervision**.
2. **Difficulty in the combination** between the members.
3. Student’s **leadership** is not enough.
4. Individual students’ **cooperating is not enough**.
5. **Poor communication** between some students.
6. The evaluating method of the project is **not diversified**.


In fact, PBL teaching mode has advantages and disadvantages. When implementing this educational model, it is necessary to pay attention to strengths or weaknesses, which will achieve better results.
