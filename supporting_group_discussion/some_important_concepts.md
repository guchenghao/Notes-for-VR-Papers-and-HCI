## 1. Big Five personality traits

The **Big Five personality traits**, also known as the **Five-Factor Model (FFM)**, is a widely recognized and empirically supported model of **personality**. Here is a brief explanation of each trait:

***Openness***: <u>**This trait reflects an individual's level of imagination, creativity, and appreciation for new experiences**</u>. People who score high on openness tend to be curious, open-minded, and willing to explore new ideas and perspectives. They may also be more likely to engage in artistic and intellectual pursuits.

***Conscientiousness***: <u>**This trait is characterized by a person's level of organization, responsibility, and self-discipline**</u>. Individuals who score high on conscientiousness tend to be reliable, diligent, and goal-oriented. They may also be more likely to plan ahead and stick to schedules.

***Extraversion***: This trait reflects an individual's level of sociability, assertiveness, and outgoingness. People who score high on extraversion tend to be talkative, energetic, and enjoy being around others. They may also be more likely to take risks and seek out stimulation.

***Agreeableness***: This trait is characterized by a person's level of compassion, cooperativeness, and concern for others. Individuals who score high on agreeableness tend to be empathetic, friendly, and willing to help others. They may also be more likely to avoid conflict and prioritize harmony in relationships.

***Neuroticism***: This trait reflects an individual's level of emotional instability and tendency towards negative emotions such as anxiety, depression, and stress. People who score high on neuroticism tend to be more sensitive, reactive, and prone to experiencing negative moods. They may also be more likely to worry and ruminate about past or future events.



## 2. PBL&TBL

### 2.1 TBL

***Team-Based Learning***: a form of collaborative learning that consists of (A) **Strategically-formed, permanent teams**, (B) **Readiness assurance**, (C) **Application activities**, and (D) **Peer evaluations**.



* **(B) Readiness assurance: The Readiness assurance process is followed by a clarifying lecture**
    1. Pre-reading by students outside of class;
    2. **Individual readiness assessment test** (iRAT) $\rightarrow$ **short, basic, multiple-choice test** over the preparation materials;
    3. **Team readiness assessment test** (tRAT) $\rightarrow$ once they turn in their individual tests, students then take the exact same test again, and must come to consensus on their team answers;
    4. **Appeals** - When teams feel they can still make a case for their answers which were marked as incorrect, they can pull out their course materials and generate written appeals.


* **(C) Application activities: carefully-designed activities**
    1. address a **significant problem** that demonstrates a concepts usefulness
    2. make a **Specific choice** among clear alternatives
    3. work on the Same problem as other teams
    4. report their decisions Simultaneously, so differences among teams can be explored for the most instructional effect

**Main features of TBL:**

* Emphasizes **APPLICATION of teacher- specified knowledge** to address real world problems In autonomous teams;
* Students benefit from immediate feedback about their teams` solutions




### 2.2 PBL

**Instructional Method**
* Tutors progressively disclose Information in cases. Learners analyze material, address knowledge deficiencies, study between sessions and come prepared to apply new knowledge to tutor led discussions




**Main features of PBL:**
* Student directed learning stimulated by challenge of solving real world problems in tutor led groups
* Learners benefit from opportunity to solve these problems
