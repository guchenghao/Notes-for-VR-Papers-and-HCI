[A Longitudinal Study of Small Group Interaction in Social Virtual Reality](https://doi.org/10.1145/3281505.3281527)


# Problem
---

## purpose

- A **in-the-wild exploratory study** of small group Interaction in Social VR

- Now that high-end consumer phones can support immersive virtual reality, They ask **whether social virtual reality is a promising medium for supporting distributed groups of users**

---

## propose

- They undertook an exploratory in-the-wild study using **Samsung Gear VR headsets** to see **how existing social groups that had become geographically dispersed could use VR for collaborative activities**

- They are particularly **interested in supporting existing groups**: thereby They can investigate **how groups might migrate to use immersive virtual reality** as a collaborative medium as an alternative to voice, picture or text messaging
---

# Methodology
---

## Useful Viewpoints

- General collaborative virtual platforms typically represent **individual users** as an **avatar inside a 3D virtual environment** where the user can **move around the virtual space**

- the **avatars** of the virtual environment would **adhere to standard turn taking protocol** during conversations as well as **noting shifts in user posture** during periods of **increased levels of intimacy**

- **Presence** is the concept that, **users of immersive virtual reality systems** believe that **they are in the virtual environment** and thus tend to **react to the environment in a manner similar to how they would in the real world** 

- In an immersive system, it is **easy** to **observe where other users are attending**, and thus **gaze becomes an important resource**

- **Participants who interacted with friends** for several hours **quickly** establishing methods to **perform the group tasks** and **engaged in small talk unrelated to the task**. In contrast, **a group of strangers coordinated poorly**

## Experiment Platform and Devices

-  Oculus Rooms

-  AltspaceVR

-  vTime

-  Samsung Gear VR headsets 

## Experimental Design

- **Diary entries and semi-structured interviews with groups and individuals** were the primary methods of data collection allowing for an **in-depth analysis of user experience**. **In-VR observations** also took place with select groups

- Overall, **17 participants were recruited to take part in the study**. This consisted of **9 females and 8 males with an age range of 24-59**, and an average age of 30.4

- **A set of introductory activities** was sent to all participants **via email** detailing the necessary steps to **familiarize users with VR**.

- **Diary study templates** were made available to all participants by the investigator, participants were required to **fill in a diary entry after each session** and **return the results by the end of the study week**

- A total of **8 semi-structured interviews across all 9 groups** took place either **in a public area or over Skype**. Interviews took **no longer than an hour** and were **spread over a 4-week period**

- Whilst engaging in social VR participants carried out **a vast range of activities**, this predominantly consisted of:

  1. Watching TV or video clips

  2. Sharing an immersive 360 VR experience

  3. Playing games

  4. Catching up with group members

## The Summarization of data from Diary Entries, Interview Transcripts and Observational Studies

- ***Users tend to mimic real-world behavior***

- ***Affective experiences in VR are comparable to affective experiences in the real world***

- ***Social VR is better suited for group interactions over one-on-one interaction***

- ***Limited mobility***

- ***Difficulty in interpreting conversation protocol without nonverbal cues***: Whilst the social VR applications include **animated mouths during times of speech**, **there is <u>no cue</u> to let users know when a group member is about to speak**

- ***Avatars tend to be representative of users***
---

# Result or Conclusion
---

- Users engaged in social VR have an **inclination** to **experience stimuli in VR <u>similarly</u> to the way they would in real life**

- Users assign a degree of **spatial awareness to their surroundings** in VR **<u>in the same way</u> they do in the real world**

- ***Several barriers*** prevented users from **experiencing the full potential of the technology**:

  - Most notably was **the <u>absence</u> of some forms of nonverbal communication**

  - The **inability** to supplement interactions with **lifelike facial expressions or hand gestures** made it **difficult to interpret certain social cues**

- Given that current social VR applications have a stylized aesthetic suggests that **virtual environments *do not have to* mimic photorealistic objects for users to feel immersed in their environment**

- This investigation demonstrates **a strong propensity** for users to **experience emotional states** in VR **<u>similarly</u> to how they are experienced in real life**

# Comment
---

1. 这篇文章是一个探索性研究，这篇文章在introduction和related work有一些观点比较有启发性，此外基本上都是老生常谈

2. 这篇文章的核心就在于 exploratory study 的设计，这篇文章的实验设计可以说是非常细致，以及对于实验记录的分析也是非常详细，虽然实验人数有点少，但是分析的思路和方法确实详细

3. 而且，文中提到的 “**Difficulty in interpreting conversation protocol without nonverbal cues**” 和 “**the absence of some forms of nonverbal communication**” 确实是**值得思考**的点

# What can be used
---

- 其实从这篇文章的部分结论中，不难看出，在一般的VR group social的情况下 verbal behavior占据主导地位，users之间在VR的环境下，基本上都是通过Voice来来进行交流，users之间也是通过语言以及语气来判断他人的情绪并进行交互，这样的情况肯定是大多数；**可以说，没有了语言交流，在VR环境下，users之间的interaction和social体验会大打折扣，甚至无法正常交流**

- 如今的VR设备和平台的技术在进步，确实能比较好的捕捉用户的facial expression，hand gesture ，但是想要做到lifelike，还是很难，再加上network delay以及其他一些因素，**users在social的时候，nonverbal communication的体验，并不会很好**

- 所以，**从另一个角度来说，在users进行交互的过程中，对于user来说，比较难捕捉到对方的一些the info of nonverbal behavior**
  
- 以上的论述，可以作为一个思考点，**在今后的研究中很有用的**
