[Near and Dear_Designing Relatable VR Agents for Training Games](https://doi.org/10.1145/3441000.3441007)


# Problem
---

## purpose

- Agents are becoming increasingly **ubiquitous** in people’s lives. There is potential for agents to **aid scalability of digital learning and training**

- There is **a gap** in literature with regards to **virtual agents** as **relatable learning companions**
---

## propose

- This paper presents **the fndings from three ideation workshops** with diferent expert groups centered around **designing playful interactions with a digital agent in Virtual Reality (VR)**, in **the context of cybersecurity training**

- This work contributes to HCI by producing **a set of design insights** to **inform design of agent based VR learning environments**

# Useful Concepts and Ideas
---

## Inspired viewpoints

- The issues of **lack of social interactions** in computer education were raised, even before the rise of Massive Online Open Courses (MOOCs), a possible solution to these issues of scalability and lack of social interaction is **the use of agents**

- While both VR and agents have potential beneft to online education, t**here is a lack of research on the design of agents for VR settings**

- Agents in multimedia learning environments are called **pedagogical agents**

- The **main representations of pedagogical agents** are in intelligent tutoring systems, as **instructors in multimedia presentations**, or as **non-player characters in educational video games**

- **Using embodied agents** makes it easier to customize scenarios for diferent user groups which leverage the scalability of role-play based training

- **Immersive reality environments** offer new possibilities for **the design of compelling social interaction experiences with computer agents** that may infuence learning experiences

- Prior studies found that **social connection and relatedness with others enhance learners’ motivation and psychological wellness**. VR specifcally has shown promise to support such connections **through increased sense of social presence**

- Students who worked with **proactive agents** had **better recall** than those who worked with **responsive ones**

- Participants had **higher confdence in an agent’s ability to perform tasks** when the agent had **a humanoid body and social behaviors** (i.e., gestures) compared to **the agent solely dependent on voice feedback**
---

# Result or Conclusion
---

- The fndings highlighted that **training programs in a virtual space** do not need to **conform to the same conventions and limitations of the real world** which is the norm in current cybersecurity training systems

- **The partner agent need not be a realistic human**. It can take the form of a **anthropomorphic robot or an animal**. This may lead to **better interactions and outcomes**

-  **using cute or abstracted agents** to **minimize any eerieness** while demonstrating both positive and negative results in phishing avoidance

# Comment
---

1. 这篇文章是一篇纯纯的定性分析和讨论的文章，主要讨论如何在VR环境下设计一个可信赖的Intelligent Agent，而且本篇文章的讨论的上下文放在CyberSecurity Training之下，所以这篇文章所讨论的那3个workshop都是讨论在CyberSecurity Training下，如何设计一个可信赖的Agent

2. 这篇文章在Introduction和related work部分讨论地非常仔细，引用了大量的文章，可以算是一个范文了

3. 这篇文章具体关于3个workshop的讨论，实际上如果不是决定要研究这个方向的话，不用细读，看结论即可

# What can be used
---

- 这篇文章因为是一篇纯定性分析的文章，没有定量分析，也没有给出Demo和实验，所以局限性很大

- **如果我之后要搞VR Education Agent的话**，这篇文章的最终结论,Introduction，related work以及关于Agent in VR的分析中，有很多观点和证言结论都值引用和借鉴

- 总的来说，这篇文章对新人还是有所启发的
