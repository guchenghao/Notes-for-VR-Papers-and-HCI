[Challenges and Design Considerations for Multimodal Asynchronous Collaboration in VR](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3359142)

## Introduction

* With the advancement of virtual reality technology, asynchronous collaboration in immersive 3D environments has become an active research area.

* **Multimodal recording**-the capture and later playback of multiple, dynamic interaction modes, such as speech, locomotion, body language, and object manipulations-is at the foundation of **asynchronous collaboration** in these VR systems.

* There is a **significant gap** of knowledge regarding the challenges and design considerations of authoring or consuming multimodal recording in VR

* Our participants were tasked to **perform asynchronously collaborative 3D design tasks** by **viewing and recording multimodal interactions**

### Research questions

* Research questions for **multimodal asynchronous VR collaboration** (MAVRC):
  * RQ1: How are social behaviors transferred from face-to-face to MAVRC?
  * RQ2: What are the challenges of maintaining workspace awareness and coordination in MAVRC?
  * RQ3: What are the challenges of navigating and creating multimodal recordings in MAVRC?

* As for RQ1:
  * MAVRC is **fundamentally different** from those of the previous studies in that asynchronous communication is one-way-the message sender cannot respond to the viewer's inquiry in real-time.
  * It is an **open question** to what extent, or if at all, users feel the **social presence** of an **embodied 3D representation** of their asynchronous collaborator and **display social behaviors** towards it

* As for RQ2:
  * **Workspace awareness** is the knowledge of ***what is going on and what others are doing***
  * **Asynchronous change awareness** is the knowledge of how **shared artefacts** (e.g., 3D models, source code, documents) have **evolved** via the contributions of time-distributed collaborators
  * Dynamic activities of one's asynchronous collaborator can occur **out of the user's view**, and the collaborator would not know how to **draw one's attention to it**

### Key findings

* Participants felt the **social presence** of asynchronous collaborators when viewing recordings, <u>leading to proxemic behaviors and empathy</u>

* Immersion in VR can cause challenges in viewing multimodal recordings, such as viewpoint disorientation or confusion from different versions of 3D scenes

* **Recording (and viewing) co-expressive speech and body language** enabled participants to **express (and understand) nuanced ideas effectively** but **highlighted needs for editing (and browsing) tools**


### Contributions

* A **conceptualization** of multimodal recording based asynchronous collaboration in VR

* **Empirical findings** on the user challenges of respecting proxemics, maintaining awareness, and consuming/producing multimodal recordings in MAVRC

* **Design implications** for multimodal recording for asynchronous collaboration: proactive proxemics management, animating changes in 3D, viewpoint display for awareness, and 3D navigational cues
