# Leadership

- The ingredients for "**effective leadership**;' however, are often debated, for leadership involves finding the right balance between: 

  - (1) keeping the members working at their tasks and improving relationships
  - (2) providing **guidance** without robbing members of their **autonomy**
---

## Leadership style

- The **leadership role** usually includes two interrelated components: **task orientation** and **relationship orientation**:

  - ***task orientation***: The task-oriented leader **focuses on the problem at hand** by defining problems for the group, establishing communication networks, providing feedback as needed, planning, motivating action, coordinating members' actions, and so on  (这个是以任务为重的leader，这种情况下，整个group更重视效率和产出，以及每个member的贡献程度，这个时候leader的地位非常重要)

  - ***relationship orientation***: Relationship leaders focus on **the quality of the relationships** among the members of the group by boosting morale, increasing cohesion, managing conflict, showing concern and consideration for group members, and additional factors (这种感觉leader更加注重成员之间的交流和关系，关注点在member)

## Participatory Leadership

- Leaders differ in how much control they exert over the group: 

  - ***autocratic leader***: 这种类型的leader对每个成员有很**明确的分工**，**member的自主性不高**，但是在这种情况下，**整个group的生产力和效率是很高的**，我觉得这种leader更加适合那种明确**task-orientated group work的场景**，比如: **OSS Project**, **online creative environment**，比较适合那种creative的场景；同时，在这种creative的场景，leader的地位和能力水平就非常重要，直接影响group的产出，而且这种情况下leader的压力（burden）也会非常大，因此关于leadership也有一套 **Distributed Leadership** 的理论
  
  - ***democratic leader***: 这种其实就是 participatory leader，**参与型leader**并不会给明确的分工，给member一定的自主性，**让member自己做决定**，不会直接去干预member的工作过程，但**leader会提供指导性的建议，并为团队指明长期的方向和步骤**，这样member具体很强的自主性；我觉得这种leader比较适合那种研究型团队工作（research-based group），我的理解就像是那种seminar，leader在相应领域具有较高的knowledge-level和experience，然后给member提供建议和指明方向，而且这种leader在整个团队讨论中，参与度是最高的
  
  - ***laissez-faire leader***: 这种leader的领导下，**member的自主性是最高的**。但是，**这种情况整个团队的效率也是最低**的。这种leader不会主动向member提供建议建议和信息，但是如果member有需求，leader也会提供一些信息。这种leader也主要是出现在research group work的场景下，比如 seminar。而且这种leader在讨论过程中属于被动交流

- Results for these three kinds of leader:

  - The **strongly directive leader** often succeeds in pushing the group to **high levels of productivity**, although at an interpersonal cost as conflict increases

  - The groups with **a participatory leader** were not as productive or efficient in their work, but **members were more satisfied with their group** and more involved

  - **Laissez-faire leaders** increased members' sense of autonomy, but their productivity was **especially low**

# Performing: Working in Groups

## Social Facilitation

![Social Facilitation](../Pictures%20and%20Graphs/Social%20Facilitation.png)

- a number of researchers suggest that **cognitive processes account for social facilitation effects**:

  - If the **task is a simple one**, this **distraction is overcome by working harder**, and performance improves. But if the **task is so complex** that the increase in motivation is **unable to offset the negative consequences of attentional conflict**, then the presence of others will lead to decrements in performance


- The **nature of this arousal** is also different, depending on **the nature of the task**:

  - When **the task is easy**, people display a challenge response. At the **physiological level**, they appear to be ready to respond to the challenge that they face

  -  But when **the task is difficult**, people display **a threat response**; they appear to be **stressed** rather than ready for effective action
---

## Social Loafing

- **loss of productivity** to two cause:

  - ***interpersonal***: when people work together they sometimes **have trouble coordinating their individual activities and contributions**, so they never reach the maximum level of efficiency

  - ***motivational***: people just **do not expend as much physical effort** when working on a collective endeavor, nor **do they expend as much cognitive effort** trying to solve problems

- **Solutions** for solving Social Loafing:

  - eliminating social loafing in their noise-malting paradigm by **making each person's contribution seem identifiable**

  - Social loafing is also minimized when subjects think that **objective standards exist that can be used to evaluate their personal performance**

  - Social loafing can also be reduced if **group members believe that their contribution to the project is important** and if **they personally value the group's goals**. People should be made to believe that their contributions are unique and essential for the group's success ()
