[Predicting Opportune Moments to Deliver Notifications in Virtual Reality](https://doi.org/10.1145/3491102.3517529)

## purpose

Current commercial VR devices provide visual, audio, and even haptic feedback, providing an immersive experience for users.

1. The feeling of presence and immersion in VR might also lead to disconnection from the real world.
2. Presenting notifications in VR allows users to stay informed about real-world events without removing their headsets, preserving the continuity and immersion of the VR experience.
3. Only a few attempts to investigate the sending of real-life notifications in VR have been made



## Main Contribution

- present the first research attempt aimed at exploring the **feasibility** of predicting **opportune moments** for sending notifications in VRs.
- focus on sensor features available on VR devices, including head-mounted displays (**HMD**), **controllers** and **eye-trackers**, for prediction, reasons:
  - they offer easily accessible information open to developers;
  - provide rich information about users


The primary objective of this paper is to examine the performance of prediction using only sensor data for prediction, as well as performance after including the additional features (e.g., engagement levels and activity categories).


research questions are as follows:

- RQ1: ***How well can sensors alone predict opportune moments for sending notifications in VR?***, sub-question: ***Which sensor type contributes the most to the prediction?***
- RQ2: ***How much improvement can information about activity condition and user engagement make, respectively, in prediction performance?***
- RQ3: ***Does a personalized model outperform a general model for predicting opportune moments in VR?***



# Core Ideas
---

1. recruited 20 participants to participate in data collection;
2. The participants underwent a total of **six VR sessions** composed of **three different VR applications**, during which we collected sensor information;
3. used a **cued retrospective method** to collect engagement labels on VR sessions they had just experienced. Using these data, we built deep learning models for the prediction tasks.
