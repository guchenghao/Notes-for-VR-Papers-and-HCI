[The Impact of Virtual Reality in the Social Presence of a Virtual Agent](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3383652.3423879)


# Problem
---

## purpose

- Their objective is to study the impact that **a social interaction with a Intelligent Virtual Agent** has on subjects across different mediums

- They focus on **how humans perceive virtual agents as social beings in a social skills context**

---

## propose

- They test the hypothesis that interacting with an **intelligent virtual character in Virtual Reality (VR)** has a stronger impact compared to the same interaction in a **traditional non-immersive platform**, both in terms of **presence and believability**

- We designed a **Social Skills Training scenario of a police interview**, based on interactions observed in real cases with the help of teachers and experts from that field

# Methodology
---

## Useful Viewpoints

- Intelligent Virtual Agents (IVAs) are computer –generated characters which can engage in realistic interactions with a participant.

## Presence and Immersion

- immersion can be **objectively measured**. Platforms are more immersive when they can deliver "an inclusive, extensive, surrounding and vivid illusion of reality to the senses of a human participant"

- In contrast to immersion, **Presence** is a **dimensional construct and captures the extent** of which a user feels present in a virtual experience environment, and, as such, **it is subjective**

- Presence can be further divided into three distinct categories: **telepresence (spatial presence), self-presence, and social presence**

-  Social Presence requires **a co-present entity** within the **virtual world** to be experienced

-  social presence has been considered to be particularly important within virtual environments with social actors (**regardless of whether they are actual people or controlled by computer algorithms**) 

## Equipments and Devices

- **FAtiMA Toolkit**
- **Daz-3D Studio**
- **BML Realizer**

## Experimental Design

- The experience is set in a **virtual room** where users play **the role of a police interrogator**r and interact with** a suspect** which is an Intelligent Virtual Agent. 

- The goal of the Player is to **interrogate a suspect** and, **without losing control of the conversation**, obtain as much information as possible.

- Dialogue Module
  
- Appraisal and Decision Making Module
  
- Expressive Behavioral Module

# Result or Conclusion
---

- On average, **Social Presence levels of the virtual suspect** felt by participants in the Virtual Reality condition were **higher than** the ones felt of participants **in the traditional setting condition**.

- the **believability levels of the virtual character in the VR condition** were **not significantly higher** to the ones felt in **traditional computer setting condition**

1. 这篇文章是一篇关于Virtual agent方面非常好的一篇文章，virtual agent的各个方面阐述非常到位，例如：如何开发Intelligent Virtual Agent，介绍很工具，对于这个领域的新人非常友好

2. 这篇的**实验和场景设计部分**写得非常详细，值得精读
   
3. 这篇文章在Introduction部分关于IVA和VR背景的描述具有引用价值，写得很细；而且，这篇文章关于**Presence和Immersion的讨论**写得非常详细，写得很好，对这方面知识很匮乏的研究者来说，非常有用

# What can be used
---

- 这篇文章的Methodology可以被借鉴到今后关于Agent和Online Collaborative Learning部分的研究中，或者VR Education中（如果确定相应的problem的话）

- 这篇文章的实现方法部分很详细，不过这篇文章所使用的工具，我都没有用过，如果确定要学习的话，要花不少时间，不能操之过急

- 总之这篇文章对于新人来说，绝对是一篇好文章
