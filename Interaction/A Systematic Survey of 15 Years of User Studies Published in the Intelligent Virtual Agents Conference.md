![IVA Research Topics](../Pictures%20and%20Graphs/../Pictures%20and%20Graphs/IVA_Research_Topics.png)


## Non-verbal and Verbal Behavior(86.1%)

-  user studies focusing on the development of behavioral aspects associated with an agent, e.g., **affective behavior, social behavior,** and **behavior exhibiting personality traits**

   - ***Social Behavior:*** 

      - **Different computational models** have been proposed for **autonomous agent behavior such** as a model trained based on human data for **turn-taking and BC behavior(Backchannel)**

      - **An agent’s ability to behave** according to a social context can highly impact how it is perceived by a human user. This ability is achieved through **social signal processing**

      - In order for human-agent interaction to be natural and believable, **researchers studied human-human interactions to develop similar social behaviors for IVAs**

   - ***Affection Behavior:*** 

      - **Expressions of emotion** can be achieved via **an agent’s facial expressions, gaze, gestures, and behaviors**

      - **building computational models** for **emotional expression development**, such as a **decision tree algorithm** to **determine the morphological and dynamic characteristics** of a virtual agent’s smiles based on user-generated descriptions

      - Other studies have looked at **how users perceive the agent’s emotions** in cases like **presence or absence of audio during agent’s facial expressions** and **congruence between an agent’s facial expression and body posture**

   - ***Personality Traits:*** 

      - Each person expresses their personality through their behavior, which **impacts their evaluations of agents and their behavior** 

      - **User perception of an agent’s personality traits** is influenced by **language extraversion**, **gesture rate**, and **gesture performance**

      - Some researchers have explored **computational models** for **generating personality-related behaviors** of IVAs and **their impact on human perception of the agent**


## Physical Appearance and Identities(13.8%)

- user studies on **physical appearance, race, ethnicity, gender, and culture**, **how agents are perceived** when **a certain identity** such as race, ethnicity, culture, and gender has been **assigned to it**

   - ***Physical Appearance:*** 

      - Exploring these behavioral and perceptual effects, researchers have experimented with effects of **varying user avatars** (e.g. **humanoid and cartoon-style**) on **sense of presence**

   - ***Identities:*** 

      - Exploring cultural effects, researchers introduced a subset of **cultural parameters** such as **gaze, proxemics, and turn-taking** to **create culturally appropriate agents**

      - **User perception of agents** was also studied in scenarios looking at **an agent’s gender and gaze behavior**


## Applications(26.2%)

- user studies of agents that were developed for **a specific application** such as **training and education, social and assistant agents**

  - IVAs can consistently demonstrate **desired behaviors, personalities, and appearances**, they are often designed to **support specific applications**

  - The type of Application with IVA can be broadly categorized into **virtual assistants** (2 papers), **training and educational agents** (8 papers), **social companions** (3 papers), and **virtual guides**

  - **Commercial “smart” virtual assistants**, such as Amazon’s Alexa, often **support voice or text input but lack a human appearance**.
---

# Result or Conclusion
---

- Their results show that conducting user studies has become **a more common practice** in the field of IVAs

- The results provided an improved understanding of **human interaction with agents**: in particular, **how it relates to an agent’s verbal and non-verbal behavior, physical appearance, and identities**

# Comment

1. 这是一篇关于IVA Research的综述类文章，文章虽然不长，但是数据统计和解析非常详细，对IVA Research Topic的划分十分合理，对于IVA领域的新人来说，是一篇不错的入门文章

2. 其次，这篇列举的3个主要Topic:(1) Non-verbal and Verbal Behavior (2)Physical Appearance and Identities (3) Application，其中关于Behavior的研究是最多的，多达86%(惊人的数据)，其次是Application，最后是Physical Appearance and Identities

3. 其实这种Topic的研究数量排序也很符合直观的逻辑判断，Behavior的研究涉及非常多心理学概念和社交理念，再加上Computer Science Support，很符合IVA的研究设定，IVA的研究本来就注重human和Agent之间的交互行为，然而human-Agent Interaction必然会涉及到非常多的心理学的概念和分析，所以这方面的论文也就非常多

# What can be used
---

- 如果之后要搞VR Agent的话，必然绕不开很多心理学上的概念，所以决定要做这方面，要把这些名词和概念基本搞懂
  
- 基于IVA的研究做的基本上都是User Study，之后设计实验的话，要考虑到这一点

- 这篇文章极大地帮助我理解了IVA领域这15年的研究Topic的分类和大致内容，虽然我目前对自己将来IVA具体研究问题还是不明确
