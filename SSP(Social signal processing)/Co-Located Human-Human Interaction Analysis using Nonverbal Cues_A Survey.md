# A survey of SSP

## HAR (Human activity recoginition)

A **major limitation** is that HAR approaches do not consider the social context in which humans perform actions and therefore they do not understand what such actions mean. For example, a HAR approach canunderstand that a person touches his/her own face by reasoning on the spatial relation between hands, face, andbody parts.

## Concepts of SSP

SSP research integrates **social psychology** concepts into **Artificial Intelligence** (AI) and focuses on automatic detection, interpretation, and synthesis of social signals, nonverbal behavioral cues (e.g.,gestures, eye gaze, body posture, vocal characteristics, interpersonal distances, facial expressions) capable to conveysocially-relevant information.

## Non-verbal cues

### Vocal behavior

Such behavior corresponds to everything in speech except words, including the use of vocalizations (e.g., fillers, laughter, and sobbing), pauses, and turn-taking. **Speaking activity** and **prosody** are thetwo aspects of vocal behavior that are most commonly used in the literature.

#### Speaking activity

The most common form of speaking activity detection is referred to as **speaker diarization**, which is the automatic segmentation of speech recordings intoturns(i.e., time intervals) in which only one of thepersons involved in an interaction is speaking

#### Prosody

Such cues account for the way people talk and in most cases correspond to how loud people speak (is captured through the energy of the speech signal) and their intonation (is captured through the fundamentalfrequency of the speech signal).

### Body Activity
