[How Will VR Enter University Classrooms? Multi-stakeholders Investigation of VR in Higher Education](https://doi.org/10.1145/3491102.3517542)


## Important viewpoints from introduction

* Using VR as an educational tool provides newforms and methods of visualization and presentation, motivates students' learning and stimulates their interest.

* it is worth notingthat higher education setting is a complex ecosystem

* Learning in VR also has a theoretical root in **constructivism learning theory**, which **advocates constructing knowledge** based on students' real experiences because ***"VR promotes thebest and probably only strategy that allows students to learn fromnon-symbolic first-person experience"***.

## Learning Theories Relevant to VR-BasedEducation

* **Constructivism theory** provides the best basis for developing VR educational applications. In constructivism, VR allows learners to build their knowledge so they may "***construct their own reality, or at least interpret it based on their perceptions of experiences***", even if they learn via distance education. There-fore, learning with instructional VR tools fits the constructivistlearning design.
  
* **Social constructivism** takes this idea further to say that students live in a social context that guides their perspective, learning in the context of their lived experiences insociety.

* **Experiential learning theory** adopts the constructivist's perspective to some extent, where teachers motivate studentsâ€™ learning from their personal experience. It newly represents learning as a four-stage cycle of **experiential stages**: **concrete experience**, **reflective observation**, **abstract conceptualization** and **active experimentation**.

* **Soical presence theory** has been offered as a theoretical foundation of educational VR. through a shared virtual environment, **enhancing social presence can lead to deeper cognitive processing** and **better learning outcomes**.

## VR Environments for Education

* **Non-immersive VR** is where users can view the 3Denvironment on a screen or stereo glasses and interact with theenvironment through a keyboard, mouse or other input devices.

* **Semi-immersive VR** is where users are surrounded by screens with projections of thevirtual environment based on their viewport.

* **Immersive VR** uses head-mounted display (HMD) with a tracking system, controller input, and other hardware, givingusers the most immersion among the three types.

## VR Explorations of Higher Education

* A systematic review of immersive VR applications for higher education noted that **engineering, computer science and astronomy were the most popular application areas**.

* **VR maturity level** remains a barrier for its adoption in regular teaching activities.
