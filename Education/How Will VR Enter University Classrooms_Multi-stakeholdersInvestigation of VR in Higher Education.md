[How Will VR Enter University Classrooms? Multi-stakeholders Investigation of VR in Higher Education](https://doi.org/10.1145/3491102.3517542)

## Important viewpoints from introduction

* Using VR as an educational tool provides newforms and methods of visualization and presentation, motivates students' learning and stimulates their interest.

* it is worth notingthat higher education setting is a complex ecosystem

* Learning in VR also has a theoretical root in **constructivism learning theory**, which **advocates constructing knowledge** based on students' real experiences because ***"VR promotes thebest and probably only strategy that allows students to learn fromnon-symbolic first-person experience"***.

## Learning Theories Relevant to VR-BasedEducation

* **Constructivism theory** provides the best basis for developing VR educational applications. In constructivism, VR allows learners to build their knowledge so they may "***construct their own reality, or at least interpret it based on their perceptions of experiences***", even if they learn via distance education. There-fore, learning with instructional VR tools fits the constructivistlearning design.

* **Social constructivism** takes this idea further to say that students live in a social context that guides their perspective, learning in the context of their lived experiences insociety.

* **Experiential learning theory** adopts the constructivist's perspective to some extent, where teachers motivate students’ learning from their personal experience. It newly represents learning as a four-stage cycle of **experiential stages**: **concrete experience**, **reflective observation**, **abstract conceptualization** and **active experimentation**.

* **Soical presence theory** has been offered as a theoretical foundation of educational VR. through a shared virtual environment, **enhancing social presence can lead to deeper cognitive processing** and **better learning outcomes**.

## VR Environments for Education

* **Non-immersive VR** is where users can view the 3Denvironment on a screen or stereo glasses and interact with theenvironment through a keyboard, mouse or other input devices.

* **Semi-immersive VR** is where users are surrounded by screens with projections of thevirtual environment based on their viewport.

* **Immersive VR** uses head-mounted display (HMD) with a tracking system, controller input, and other hardware, givingusers the most immersion among the three types.

## VR Explorations of Higher Education

* A systematic review of immersive VR applications for higher education noted that **engineering, computer science and astronomy were the most popular application areas**.

* **VR maturity level** remains a barrier for its adoption in regular teaching activities.

## Methods

### Participants

* 18 participants (nine students and nine instructors)

![Participants_VR_education](../Pictures%20and%20Graphs/Participants_details_VR_education.png)

### Procedure

![overview_procedure_study](../Pictures%20and%20Graphs/Study_Procedure_VR_education.png)

1. **First Round Interview: Student and Instructor Interviews:** (1) understand the role of technology currently played in classrooms, (2) talk about participants' past experience or knowledge of using VR,and (3) discuss the potential and future of using VR in educational activities.

2. **Student and Instructor Participatory Design Workshop:** We conducted two workshops for each participatinggroup for the purpose of: (1) identifying stakeholders' priorities and giving insights to second-round interviews (expert staff interviews); (2) having a deeper discussion of the themes raised in the prior inter-views based on the role (instructor or student); (3) understanding thecontemporary VR technologies and characterizing future opportunities.

3. **Technical Possibilities Workshop:** We led two sessions fortechnical possibilities workshop: pre-workshop session and workshop session. We asked them to get familiar with ***Miro*** and try a list of VR applications: ***Engage***; ***Spatial***; ***Wander***.

4. **Ideation Workshop:** We concluded themes (e.g., benefits and challenges of using VR in higher education) of educational VR from first-round interviews. During the ideation workshop, participants first formed small groups of instructors and students and discussed the themes which are similar to our themes mentioned in the results sections. In the end, <u>**participants were asked to work individually to rate each idea**</u>. A higher score meant "more expected features or ideas" (rates ranged from 0 to 4)
   1. **Core group:** includes the most important stakeholders inusing VR in the class.
   2. **Involved group:** provides input or helps to VR-supported class, but this kind of class is not their sole focus.
   3. **Informed group:** wants to stay up to date and will provide feedback/input when necessary.
   4. **Irrelevant group:** doesn’t need to be considered as stakeholders.

5. **Second Round Interview: Expert Staff Interviews:** We recruited and ran second-round interviews for those stakeholders identified as core or involved stakeholders. They were asked to provide general descriptions of their responsibilities in facilitating VR-supported activities.

### Qualitative Content Analysis

To analyze the qualitative data generated from the interviews and workshops (including participant notes, discussions and ideas), weconverted all data into a textual format and used **data-driven thematic analysis** (following the **grounded-theory** inspired process) to **code the text** and **find meaningful patterns within the codes**.

## Results

![Table of barinstorm](../Pictures%20and%20Graphs/brainstorm_of_VR_education.png)

* VR's authentic social environments can also serve **various instructional goals**. Instructors described various situations in whichVR can support knowledge and skills acquisition by creating a cer-tain social environment, including **teaching skills** (S7), **language skills** (I7), **leadership skills** (I6), **communication** and **presentations kills** (I3, I5), and for **ethics learning** (e.g., **sexual harassment**) (I6).

* ***Accessing Otherwise Inaccessible Learning Contexts***: (通过VR可以让学生体验一些比较危险的实验，让学生体验到无法课堂上体验的场景)
  * Learning contexts can be accessed using VR no matter the geographiclocation, the distance, or the time
  * VR provides a safe replacement for dangerous orunethical activities in the real world

* ***Understanding and Remembering Visual and Spatial Knowledge***: (通过VR可以让学生更好得从空间和视觉的角度(3D模型)理解知识，例如：身临其境体验细胞内部的运行机制)
  * VR can help learners better understand and remember **visual and spatial aspects** by **providing an immersive and interactive 3D environment**.

* ***Supporting Embodied Learning***: (在VR中，学生通过avatar能够获得视觉，触觉等多种感官不同的体验，让学生拥有更高的参与度)
  * Embodied learning theory advocates an education method that not only **offers an intellectual way of teaching** but also involves the whole body, including <u>vision, touch, proprioception, interoception, motor control, and vestibular sensations</u>.

* ***Attracting Students through Novelty***: (VR在学习上具有新颖性，能够激发学生的学习热情和参与度)
  * VR can engage students and **stimulate their interest**, promoting interest-driven learning.
  * This is an especially **important benefit of VR** because it can "**increase motivation to learn.**"
  * The **engagement** as "a prime reason forusing VR in class"

* Course  Design  Investment: 

* **Financial Consideration**: Consummer-level VR headsets

* Health Concerns

* Learning Curve (VR的学习成本要不学会使用手机的成本高很多，这也是困难之一)

* Technology Management (管理VR设备也是非常重要的一环)

## Discussion

* ***Inequity in VR Use May Be a Deal Breaker to Its Adoption***: (1) integrate **multi-sensory cues**; (2) advocates **embodied learning** to accommodate a wide range of abilities
  * Sickness in VR
  * Gender (不同性别的人得VR眩晕症的概率不同)
  * Disabled community

* ***Collaborative Social Experiences are Key to VR’s Success in the Classroom***:
  * Our work points out the importance of **collaborative social experiences** that VR can achieve in students' learning processes
  * Most participants identified the ability to create a realistic social environment that supports collaboration as one key benefit of VR
  * ***Allowing students to have both private and public discussions*** is <u>another noteworthy design</u> raised in the workshop.

* For *in-class management*, VR tools should be provided by *intuition* to **ease the stress of technology management** by offering straightforward ways such as <u>**forming teams, releasing notice, sharing resources or doing other common educational activities**</u>. (需要根据不同的教学或者学习内容来定制VR场景和相关教育功能)
