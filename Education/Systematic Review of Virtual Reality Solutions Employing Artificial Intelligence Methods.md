# Problem
---

## purpose

- Systematic Review
---

## propose

- This paper presents a systematic literature review of artificial intelligence (AI) methods used in virtual reality (VR) solutions.
---

# Useful Concepts and Ideas
---

## Inspired viewpoints

- VR is defined as an **advanced computer technology** that provides users **multiple intuitive sensations** while simulating mechanisms in a physical or imaginary world.


- AI methods introduced in **a machine present the ability to create, plan, learn, process logic, and ratiocinate** like a human.

- Education is the **most dominant economic sector** for AI and VR research.

- **Machine learning** is prioritized when AI is employed in VR projects

## Limitation of AI-based systems

- there are systems that do not perform well when applied to scenarios that are very different from those they were trained on
  
- Some applications can have high computational costs
---

# Result or Conclusion
---

- The findings revealed several fields of applications in the real world that employ AI in VR, such as **teleconferencing, human-robot interaction, emotion interaction and behavior recognition**, education, agriculture, transport and tourist services, **image data extraction, 3D image reconstruction, cognitive load measurement**, and health.
  
- when using AI methods in VR applications, the main advantages are **high precision of the algorithms and high efficiency**.

- the combination of AI and VR contributes to new trends and opportunities for **human–machine interactive devices**, leading to customer satisfaction and loyalty.

- AI and VR contribute to the health area to promote efficiency and precision in surgical operations, in addition to allowing the rehabilitation of treated patients


# Comment

1. 这是一篇涵盖了很多研究方向和研究场景的review paper, 非常具有参考价值
   
2. 关于AI在VR领域的应用， 文章列举了非常多的领域和场景，根据个人研究方向，如果要进一步展开研究的话，可以考虑从这篇review paper的参考文献入手。
   
3. 从这篇文章不难看出，VR application近几年应用最多且最集中的领域就是Education(除去零散的研究统计)，但是文章关于AI在VR Education里具体应用的例子，却列举得不多。一方面说明AI在VR Education里的应用很大程度上需要结合非常具体的应用场景，另一方面说明将来这方面的研究也具有一定的可行性。

# What can be used
---

- 就以我目前的感受来说，AI在VR中的应用，感觉集中在gaze or eye-tracking, behavior recognition, emotion interaction(主要在认知，心理和行为这几个方面)，这几个方面的研究，**个人认为需要相当量的前置知识**，所以如果将这几个方面的研究与Education领域结合起来，应用场景就比较难找，而且有限（**故事不好说**）
  
- 如果考虑将AI与 VR Education结合起来，最首要也是最重要的就是找一个合适的应用场景或者可操作的problem（**把故事背景搞定，实验设计和方案设计一般不会有特别的障碍**）
