## purpose

- Explore study

- The implications of this study help students develop their 21st century skills and make them future ready
---

## propose

- This study attempts to address the question: **How can designing authentic online distance learning assessments improve student performance in an Asian History class?**
  
- **Primary research data** was obtained by **selecting one Grade 7 intact class (N=38)** with lesson on **“Physical Features of Asia”**
  
-  A learning guide and learning playlist were designed with authentic assessments **using G Suite for Education applications**

# Method and Solution
---

## Theory for Research

- Gulikers, Bastiaens, and Kirschner (2006) affirm this by identifying five dimensions of authentic assessments – **assessment task, physical context, social context, assessment result or form, and assessment criteria**
  
- Newmann and Wehlage (1993) articulated five standards for authentic instruction, namely **higher-order thinking, depth of knowledge, connected to the world, substantive conversation and social support for student achievement**, to **assess the extent to which an activity engages students to achieve the standards**

## Research Design

- Data from **38 Grade 7 students (21 males and 17 females)** were gathered.
  
- **G Suite** for Education applications such as Google Classroom, Google Docs, Google Forms,Google Slides, and Google Meet were utilized.
  
- Data were gathered by obtaining the scores of the **formative and summative assessments, self-assessment student ratings, and responses of the feedback form**.
  
- notes and observations were recorded, which underscored how students responded to the assessments by comparing it with their self-assessment ratings.

# Result or Conclusion
---

- The findings of the study show that authentic assessments enable students to apply their skills in performing authentic tasks. The results also affirm that teachers are encouraged to reflect on the relevance of what they teach.

- It is evident that the students demonstrated learning based on the high assessment scores, high self-assessment ratings, and highly positive perception on how the lesson was delivered.

- The high assessment scores, self-assessment ratings, and positive perception of the students can also serve as baseline for the next research cycle.

1. 这篇文章并不是关于VR在Online distance Learning中的应用，但是这篇文章的一些关于Assessment of Online distance learning的结论比较有启发意义
   
2. 这篇文章的实验或研究设计非常详细，虽然这与我将来的研究目标并不是很契合，但是这篇文章的**实验设计部分**还是可以参考借鉴的
