# Background:
* a. Subject and characteristics:
  * The paper investigates the use of the Experiential Learning Theory to modify the Problem-Based Learning (PBL) method in software engineering education to achieve better learning outcomes.
* b. Historical development
  * PBL has been widely used in higher education as an alternative to traditional teaching methods. The Experiential Learning Theory emphasizes the importance of the active experimentation stage, which is often overlooked in PBL.
* c. Past methods
  * Past methods of teaching software engineering education lacked active experimentation, leading to limited learning outcomes among students.
* d. Past research shortcomings
  * Past research focused on evaluating the effectiveness of PBL without incorporating the Experiential Learning Theory's active experimentation stage.
* e. Current issues to address
  * The need to improve learning outcomes of software engineering students using a modified PBL method that includes the active experimentation stage in accordance with the Experiential Learning Theory.
# Methods:
* a. Study's theoretical basis
  * The study is based on the Experiential Learning Theory to modify the PBL method to include the active experimentation stage, which is believed to enhance learning outcomes.
* b. Article's technical route (step by step)
  * A quasi-experiment was designed and conducted in three software engineering courses at an undergraduate level, in Rio Branco-Acre/Brazil. The courses were taught by the same teacher, with one class using the standard PBL method as the control group and two classes using a modified PBL method that incorporated the Experiential Learning Theory as treatment groups. The problem-solving activities were carried out in accordance with the PBL process, with the control group following the standard PBL process and the treatment groups modifying the PBL process to include the active experimentation stage. Data was collected through surveys taken by the students, which evaluated their motivation, experience, and learning outcomes. The data collected was analyzed using statistical methods.
# Conclusion:
* a. Work significance
  * The paper investigates the use of the Experiential Learning Theory to modify the PBL method in software engineering education, which is significant in improving learning outcomes among students.
* b. Innovation, performance, and workload
  * Modifying the PBL method with the Experiential Learning Theory's active experimentation stage achieved better results in motivation, experience, and learning outcomes among software engineering students, compared to the traditional PBL method. There was a limited impact on learning outcomes in the modified PBL method. The workload for professors was addressed by conducting a training process with the participant professors and making ourselves available for guidance throughout the entire research period.
* c. Research conclusions (list points)
  * Modifying the PBL method with the Experiential Learning Theory's active experimentation stage can significantly enhance learning outcomes among software engineering students.
  * PBL approaches should provide students with the opportunity to deal with more than only one problem to improve their motivation and experience in the learning process.
  * There are validity limitations to the data collection strategy used in this study, and future studies should use other types of data collection approaches, such as observation, to more reliably verify the effects of the Experiential Learning Cycle on the PBL method.
  * The experiment was carried out on a small scale, and there are threats to validity that need to be addressed. Therefore, similar studies should be carried out at other times and in other contexts to generalize the conclusions.
  * This study can serve as a basis for future research and can contribute to improving the PBL method in software engineering education.
