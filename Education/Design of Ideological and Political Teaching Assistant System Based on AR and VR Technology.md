# Comment

1. 这篇文章虽然标题是有说VR Technology，但是通篇并未对VR的应用进行很详细的描述，很显然对于这篇文章来说，**VR只是一个技术工具**.

2. 这篇文章的重点在基于现有的SPOC教育模式，引入VR工具，来打造一种新型的online learning的平台，因此**这篇文章的卖点在于一种新的在线学习模式**.
   
3. 个人感觉这篇文章算是反映了现在很多VR Education的paper，基本上把VR当做一个新颖的工具，而且VR Education的paper很多都是**VR + 新教学模式，VR + 特定的教学场景 + case study or explore study**，而且在**medical和人文社科**领域应用和研究非常多的，很少去关注VR技术本身或者VR技术和其他技术的结合.

# What can be used
---

- 这篇文章对我未来设想的研究来说，唯一的利用价值就在于**在background里可以引用**

- 不过SPOC这种在线学习模式，对未来设计学习模式，有一定的启发性
