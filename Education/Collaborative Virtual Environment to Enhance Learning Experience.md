[Collaborative Virtual Environment to Enhance Learning Experience](https://doi.org/10.1145/3160908.3160912)


# Problem
---

## purpose

- **Case Study** of student projects (create 3D environment) by using an **online collaborative virtual environment platform(Minecraft)** to enhance their collaborative learning experience
---

## propose

- This projects **main intention** was to **adapt the seven principles of facilitating student engagement** by using the virtual reality medium as technology

- The reviews highlighted by the students were also discussed to derive **an insight of the specific elements** that can **enhance student’s engagement and learning experience** for collaborative virtual environment

# Useful Concepts and Ideas
---

## Inspired viewpoints

- **A concept of collaboration** comes when there are **two or more participants** with roles **working together by using some techniques**, steps or objects at the same location, or a platform, and in a same time to **complete a common goal or objective together**

- The **challenge of 21st century generation of learners** requires **more active and collaborative learning strategies** to enhance learning experiences and **engagement**

- **Student collaborative engagement** is often cited as one of the **most significant indicators** in determining student success to **not only transfer knowledge but to create enjoyable learning centered environments**

-  **Collaborative learning** is refers as **interaction** that have a **purposive intent** and a general set of **structural elements** to **facilitate it such as working together in small groups toward a common goal**


- **seven principles** to **facilitate student engagement**, which include: 

  1. student/faculty contact

  2. cooperation among students

  3. active learning : **any teaching method that engages students in the learning process** by requiring them to **do meaningful activities** and **use constructive thinking skills**

  4. prompt feedback

  5. time on task

  6. high expectations

  7. respect for diverse talents and ways of learning (尊重多样化的人才和学习方式)


- The **characteristic for NCVE(Network collaborative virtual environment)**:

  - the **importance of a presence** on behalf of another user in virtual environment through **representation/avatars/inhabitants**

  - a **common space** that everyone can **share and interact with**

  - the **timing** of the virtual meeting

  - the **universal sign language** that they can use to **fast communicate with another team** **without have to type the message**

  - the **design of navigation and way-finding** to guide them exploring the virtual environment

  - the **importance of user interface** to ensure that **the communication among participants become smooth**
---

# Result or Conclusion
---

- The **sense of presence** in virtual collaboration was very important to ensure that they know **with who’s they are working** and it will helps in term of **determining their coordinate and position**

- For the communication, apart from the **audio feedback from the game**, **communications via text** in virtual environment was **not enough and limited**

# Comment

1. 这篇文章是一个case study，个人感觉比较一般，从实验设计和文书上，可以明确发现和顶尖论文还是有很大的差距的

2. 这篇文章基于Minecraft平台进行实验，设置了6个collaborative group进行一些construction的task，以此来实现并验证关于**促进学生写作参与度的7条原则**

3. 这篇文章关于结论部分，个人而言，我觉得分析过于简单，仅仅从每个group在协作过程中遇到的问题(issues)这个角度进行分析，意义不大，而且**并没有具体从每个group成员的interaction行为(behavior)进行分析**，这使得这篇文章的结论过于单薄

4. 而且，这篇文章也提到了**the sense of presence**这个概念，但是这篇文章似乎只是从表象或具象的层面来描述presence这个概念，不够深入

# What can be used
---

- 这篇文章提到了对于the success of collaborative learning来说，**students collaborative engagement**是一个很重要的评判指标，如果之后继续搞online collaborative learning, 可以考虑从这个指标入手，看看是否有文章可以做

- 而且这篇文章提到的**7条原则**，在之后的研究中说不定也可以用到
