[Visualizing Convolutional Neural Networks with Virtual Reality](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3359996.3364817)

# Problem
---

## purpose

- there is a **growing need** for common programmers and machine learning newcomers to understand the general functioning of these algorithms. 
  
- However, as neural networks are complex in nature, **novel presentation means** are required to enable rapid access to the functionality.
---
## propose
-  this paper examines how CNNs can be visualized in Virtual Reality
  
- **A first exploratory study** has confirmed that our visualization approach is both intuitive to use and conductive to learning
  
- Our main goal is to get insights in whether the use of virtual reality technology enables visualization possibilities that **facilitate the learning process of understanding artificial neural networks**

# Result or Conclusion
---

- Immersive VR has the potential to facilitate learning about architecture of CNNs.
  
- VR provide a **stable learning environment** for studying CNNs.
  
- Their study also confirms that their visualization approach is both**intuitive and engaging**.
