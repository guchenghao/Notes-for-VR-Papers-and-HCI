## purpose

- The **emergence of virtual reality technology** has provided a new development space for distance higher education. 

- **Review and furture work of VR Application in Distance Higher Education**
---

## propose

- This paper expounds **the significance of virtual reality (VR) technology** applied to distance higher education

- systematically introduces the **composition of VR distance education system**, and proposes five application modes of VR distance higher education, including **self-exploration learning, simulation experiment learning, and distance open learning, distance group discussions and distance education platforms**

- the **challenges** faced by VR technology in the application of distance higher education are summarized based on the current status

## VR Distance Higher Education Application Mode

- ***Self-exploration Learning***:

  - learners can **receive online education through the online platform**, but the human-machine interaction of this online education is relatively poor, and it is difficult to stimulate students’ interest in learning

  - Whenever and wherever they have the learning requirements, **the online platform can satisfy their needs immediately**

- ***Simulation Experiment Learning***

- Distance Open Learning

- ***Distance Group Discussion***:
  - As an important form of learning for distance education, **the study group’s regular discussion activities are one of the basic learning methods** to ensure the quality of distance education

  - It is found that **the “group discussion” teaching method can effectively integrate the disordered student groups into an orderly teaching process**, which can combine experience learning with social practice

## Challenges for VR Application

- The **biggest challenge** in the application of VR technology in education is **the lack of educational resources**, and **the technical requirements for the design and development of teaching resources are too high**

- Under the existing immersive virtual reality technology, **it is difficult for teachers to monitor the teaching process** and the systematic and perfect **virtual teaching theory guidance** are **scanty**
  
-  At present, the development of virtual products **lack open design and implementation standards**

-  Even though virtual reality technology can record all the students’ learning process data, **how to use it to evaluate and improve the behavior of both teaching and learning has no mature solution**
---

# Result or Conclusion
---

- the application of virtual reality technology in higher education is **not a one-step process and requires long-term exploration and practice**

- Especially the key technologies, such as **dynamic environment modeling technology, three-dimensional graphics generation technology, and system integration technology,** have yet to be further improved
