[Online Collaborative Learning of a Mixed Team_A Case Study of Hotel and Tourism Students from Varied Education Backgrounds](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3345120.3345137)


# Problem
---

## purpose

- Case study

- This case study explores the perception of hotel and tourism students from a university in Hong Kong on their online collaborative learning experience of **a team of members from varied education backgrounds**.
---

## propose

- The findings may help educators **develop strategies in student group formation and facilitation** for *mixed teams* for effective online collaborative learning.
---

# Useful Concepts and Ideas
---

## Inspired viewpoints

- **Homogenous groups tend to be more productive when mutual understanding can be reached easier** whereas the collaboration by heterogeneous teams appears to be more all-rounded with more diverse perspectives from member.
  
- **higher cohesiveness** is found when working among **homogeneous groups** compared to heterogeneous groups.
  
- Considering the ultimate goal of learning and the importance of academic achievement, l**earning outcome is often of more concern compared to learning process**.
  
- **Cooperative groups** tend to **divide the group work into smaller tasks** for individual members to complete independently whereas **collaborative groups** appear to **value more on the interactions** between members for completing the group work.
  
- Educators may need to put more effort in **facilitating activities for varied learners** to enhance online collaborative learning
---

# Result or Conclusion
---

-  collaborative learning process tends to be more efficient when **instant interactions** can be arranged, especially with **passive learners** in a team
  
-  a higher assessment weighting of an activity may encourage more participation in online collaborative learning environment.
  
-  an activity with more **complex content** encouraging more perspectives from learners can be considered.
-  Learning from the viewpoint of learners, facilitators may make better decisions

-  For more effective online collaborative learning process, **more homogeneity in a team is recommended**.
