[Digital Transformations of Classrooms in Virtual Reality](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3411764.3445596)


# Problem
---

## purpose

- With rapid developments in consumer-level head-mounted displays and computer graphics, immersive VR has the potential to **take online and remote learning closer to real-world settings**

- the efects of such digital transformations on learners, particularly for VR, **have not been evaluated in depth**
---

## propose

- This work investigates the **interaction-related efects** of **sitting positions of learners**, **visualization styles of peer-learners and teachers**, and **hand-raising behaviors of virtual peer-learners** on learners in an immersive VR classroom, using eye tracking data
---

# Methodology
---

## Useful Viewpoints

- **one of the disadvantages of teaching and learning in VR or online** compared to conventional classroom-based settings is the **limited social interaction** with teachers and peer-learners.

- Next-generation VR platforms such as **Engage or Mozilla Hubs** may ofer better social engagement for learners in the virtual environments; however, **the efects of such environments on learners have to be better investigated**.

- The digital transformations of classrooms refect **an important and critical step** when developing VR environments for learning purposes and require further research

- A thorough analysis of the **eye movements** allows to infer information on the users going beyond the gaze position, for example **stress, cognitive load, visual attention, evaluation and diagnosis of diseases, future gaze locations, or training evaluation**

- One disadvantage of such VR and online learning tools is that learners’ motivation and performance may be affected by **lack of social interaction, peer accompaniment, or immersion**.

## Equipments and Devices

- HTC Vive Pro Eye 
- Unreal Game Engine3 v4.23.1
- Tobii eye tracker 

## Experimental Design
- The main purpose of our study is to investigate the effects of digital transformations of the classrooms to **VR settings on learners**. Therefore, we designed **a user-study to study these efects**

- Participants were recruited from local academic track schools via **e-mails and invitation letters**, **381 volunteer** sixth-grade students (179 female, 202 male)

- A **virtual teacher** standing in front of the classroom teaches **a ≈ 15-minute virtual lecture** to the students about computational thinking

- The lecture has four phases including:  (a) topic introduction (≈ 3 minutes), (b) knowledge input (≈4.5 minutes), (c) exercises (≈ 5.5 minutes), and (d) summary (≈ 1.5 minutes)

- Lastly, participants flled out **questionnaires** about **their experienced presence and perceived realism**
---

# Result or Conclusion
---

- Our results indicate that **participants located in the back** of the virtual classroom may have diffculty extracting information during the lecture

- if the **avatars in the classroom are visualized in realistic styles**, participants may attend the lecture in a more focused manner instead of being distracted by the visualization styles of the avatars

- **Few indicators** were obtained from **the evaluation of the different hand-raising behaviors** of peer-learners, providing a general understanding of attention towards peer-learner performance

- These fndings ofer **valuable insights about design decisions** in the VR classroom environment
